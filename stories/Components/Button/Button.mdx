# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content for VÃ­ctor

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

import { Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

- [Primary](#primary)

- [Large](#large)
- [Small](#small)

### Primary

<Story id="lit-components-button--primary" />

### Secondary

<Story id="lit-components-button--secondary" />

### Large

<Story id="lit-components-button--large" />

### Small

<Story id="lit-components-button--small" />
